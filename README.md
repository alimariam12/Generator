## Homework #1: JavaScript Password Generator

### Task
For our homework this week we were asking to create a password generator using Javascript. This was our first assignment we were given and had to use Javascript. This generator will allow you to get a randomized password with the following criteria:
 - Length (between 8 to 128 characters).
 - If you'd like to include Uppercase Letters.
 - If you'd like to include Lowercase Letters.
 - If you'd like to include Special Character.
 - If you'd like to include Numbers.
 - Must include at least one of the criterias.
